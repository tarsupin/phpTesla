------ About the Cookie_Site Class ------
-----------------------------------------

This class is identical to Cookie_Server in every way but one: its cookies are exclusive to a single site (domain) on the server. It will use the full domain to identify the site instead of the base domain.

If you want to remember this cookie across multiple sub-domains that are hosted on the same server, use the Cookie_Server:: class.

Note: All behavior modification is handled within Cookie_Server:: - you do not need to create any methods here.
